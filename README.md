The client for out projects was Artemis Financial who was working on a web app that would allow for financial advising.
It is always important to keep security in mind through the entire development process. During the process of this class there are several layers of security I added.
I worked with secure certificates, check sums and dependency checks to help move the project forward however I don't feel any of it was done very well.
I am however greatful to have a professor who took the time to give thorough feedback.

This is very difficult material, picking up a book just simply isn't enough. On top of having problems with the code provided there were many other along the way. I had to ask help of friends in the
business to complete several assignments as well as make generous use of youtube. I don't feel SNHU did a good job of putting this course together, which is how I feel about
many of the ones I've taken there in the past. 
I'm extremely frustrated and looking forward to being done.
